# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Hi! My name is Michael Koohang, and I'm a software engineer.

I started out my career at a young age fascinated by the amazing things computers could do. It felt like wizardry when writing my first line of code back in high school (I love Harry Potter, so you could imagine my excitement). I knew almost immediately in that moment that I wanted to make this my career. 

Taking a less traditional route, I left high school after sophomore year to study software engineering as a dual enrollment student at my local university. I spent my time working as a lab assistant and tutor, immersing myself into the world of software while also teaching my passion along the way. This is where I had the opportunity to build software for people other than myself for the first time. That's when I started to realize the importance of not just building cool things, but building the right things, and for the right people. 

Realizing my passion for design and what I later came to know as "HCI," I graduated from undergrad at 18 and pursued a master's degree in computer science with a focus in Human-Computer Interaction. This is where I got to work on some amazing projects and research that taught me the value of the skills that I possess, not just to myself, but to my community as well. Many of my projects were based in civic environments and involved solving problems in my local community. Whether it was decreasing rat infestations in impoverished neighborhoods, organizing fragmented housing data, or increasing internet access in tribal communities, the work showed me how I can make a difference in my community with the skills and knowledge I possess.

I find myself with a mix of engineering, design, teaching, and research experience that I'm excited to apply in industry. I'm able to work very effectively in diverse, innovative, and fast-paced teams, tackle multi-dimensional problems, and communicate effectively across a variety of disciplines. My skills include rapid design (human-centered design, thematic analysis, user personas), prototyping (Sketch, Miro), and engineering of full stack and mobile apps (iOS, React, Node).

Outside of work, I love playing soccer, DJing, and volunteering to teach math and computer science. You'll always see me with pair of headphones on hand or on head. Feel free to check out my portfolio and reach out anytime! I'd love to chat!
