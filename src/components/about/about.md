# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

---
My name is Michael, and I'm a software engineer.

I started out my career at a young age fascinated by the amazing things computers could do. It felt like wizardry when writing my first line of code back in high school. I knew almost immediately in that moment that I wanted to make this my career.

Taking a less traditional route, I left high school after sophomore year to study software engineering as a dual enrollment student at my local university. I spent my time working as a lab assistant and tutor, immersing myself in the world of software while teaching my passion along the way. This is where I had the opportunity to build software for people other than myself for the first time. It's also when I started to realize the importance of not just building cool tech, but understanding how to build tech so it could truly help others.

Realizing my passion for design and what I later came to know as "HCI," I graduated from undergrad at 18 and pursued a master's degree in computer science with a focus in Human-Computer Interaction. This is where I got to work on some amazing projects that taught me the value of the skills that I possess, not just to myself, but to my community as well. Many of my projects were based in civic environments and involved solving problems in my local community. Whether it was decreasing rat infestations in local neighborhoods, organizing fragmented housing data, or expanding internet access in tribal communities, the work showed me how I can make a difference in my community with the skills and knowledge I possess.

My background includes a mix of engineering, design, teaching, and research experience. I work well in fast-paced teams, can ideate, prototype, design and engineer technology very rapidly, and am able to communicate clearly between various disciplines. My skills include human-centered design (design thinking, qualitative research methods, interviewing), rapid prototyping (Figma, paper prototyping), and software engineering (iOS, Swift, React, JavaScript).

Outside of work, I love playing soccer, DJing, and volunteering to build software for non-profits. You'll always see me with pair of headphones on hand or on head. Feel free to check out my portfolio and reach out! I'd love to chat!
